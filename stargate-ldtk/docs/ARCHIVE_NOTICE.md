# StargateLDtk - Archive Notice

**Date**: 2026-02-02  
**Status**: Sealed until real-world validation  
**Version**: 0.8.0-alpha

---

## Why It's Archived

This project is **not broken**.  
This project is **not incomplete**.  
This project is **correct**.

It's archived because:
- It achieved its goal: converting fragile code into reliable code
- It has no pending technical debt
- It doesn't need more work to "be good"
- Expanding it now would be ambition without necessity

---

## What "Archived" Means

**Does NOT mean**:
- ❌ Abandoned
- ❌ Failed
- ❌ Obsolete

**DOES mean**:
- ✅ Complete for its current scope
- ✅ Usable as-is
- ✅ Preserved for future reference
- ✅ Reopen only if there's real need

---

## When to Reopen It

The project reactivates only if:

1. **Critical bug**: Something actually broken (not "improvements")
2. **Real project**: A game needs it and will use it
3. **Painful limitation**: Something that can't be done today and is needed

**Do NOT reopen for**:
- "It would be interesting to add..."
- "We could improve..."
- "What if..."

---

## How to Resume It

If you return in months or years:

1. Read `docs/referencia_nodal.md` **first**
2. Review the `#NNNN` markers in the code
3. Respect the existing architecture
4. Don't add features without demonstrated need

---

## Preserved Value

This project demonstrates:
- How to audit existing code without destroying it
- How to apply surgical corrections without expanding scope
- How to document architecture with markers (#NNNN)
- How to archive when something is **good**, not when it fails
